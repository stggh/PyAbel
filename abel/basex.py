#   MR exposed BASIS_SET_CUTOFF for speed/accuracy control.
# 2018-10-07
#   MR added intensity correction.
#   Also smaller basis sets are now reused when generating larger ones.
#   Removed unnecessary scipy methods (scipy.dot is actually numpy.dot).
# 2018-10-03
#   MR completely rewrote basis generation (half-width, efficiency).
#   Switched from (n, nbf) to (n, sigma) basis specification;
#   nbf is now determined automatically, and nbf != n actually works.
#   The regularization parameter now differs from BASEX.exe by a factor
#   of 4/pi (BASEX.exe had an incorrect prefactor in basis projections).
# 2018-09-29
#   MR improved loading cached basis sets:
#   If the required basis is not available, but a larger compatible is,
#   then the latter will be loaded and cropped to the required size.
# 2018-09-19
#   MR switched to half-width transform.
#   The results now match BASEX.exe.
# 2018-09-08
#   MR enabled Tikhonov regularization.
#   Also, basis and transform matrices are now kept in memory
#   between invocations and reloaded/recalculated only when needed.
# Version 0.62 - 2016-03-07
#   DH changed all linear algebra steps from numpy to scipy
#   Scipy uses fortran fftpack, so it will be faster on some systems
#   or the same speed as numpy in most cases.
# Version 0.61 - 2016-02-17
#   Major reformatting - removed up/down symmetic version and
#   made basex work with only one quadrant.
# Version 0.6 - 2015-12-01
#   Another major code reformatting
# Version 0.5 - 2015-11-16
#   Code cleanup
# Version 0.4 - 2015-05-0
#   Major code update see pull request

def basex_transform(data, sigma=1.0, reg=0.0, correction=False,

    """
    This function performs the BASEX (BAsis Set EXpansion)
    Abel transform. It works on a "right side" image. I.e.,
    it works on just half of a cylindrically symmetric
    object, and ``data[0,0]`` should correspond to a central pixel.
    To perform a BASEX transorm on
    a whole image, use ::

        abel.Transform(image, method='basex', direction='inverse').transform

    This BASEX implementation only works with images that have an
    odd-integer full width.

    Note: only the `direction="inverse"` transform is currently implemented.


    Parameters
    ----------
    data : **m** × **n** numpy array
        the image to be transformed.
        ``data[:,0]`` should correspond to the central column of the image.
    sigma : float
        width parameter for basis functions, see equation (14) in the article.
        Determines the number of basis functions (**n**/**sigma** rounded).
        Can be any positive number, but using **sigma** < 1
        is not very meaningful and requires regularization.
    reg : float
        regularization parameter, square of the Tikhonov factor.
        ``reg=0`` means no regularization,
        ``reg=100`` is a reasonable value for megapixel images.
    correction : boolean
        apply intensity correction in order to reduce method artifacts
        (intensity normalization and oscillations)
    basis_dir : str
        path to the directory for saving / loading the basis-set coefficients.
        If ``None``, the basis set will not be saved to disk.
    dr : float
        size of one pixel in the radial direction.
        This only affects the absolute scaling of the transformed image.
    verbose : boolean
        determines whether statements should be printed
    direction : str
        the type of Abel transform to be performed.
        Currently only accepts value ``'inverse'``.


    Returns
    -------
    recon : **m** × **n** numpy array
